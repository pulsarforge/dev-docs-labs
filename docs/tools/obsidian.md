# Obsidian

Regarding note taking, obsidian is a good choice. 

From my point of view there are better ways to use it and less useful ways to use this desktop app.

While some people take notes only to growth the force node graph I think It is better approach the writing as evolving documents and interconnect the knowledge between the areas therefore config your setup to achieve the preferred outcome.
